      "answer": "The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is an attention mechanism that relates different positions within a single sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. It enables the model to capture dependencies between elements in the sequence without relying on recurrence or convolution. \n\nIn self-attention, the keys, values, and queries all originate from the same sequence, allowing each position in the sequence to attend to all other positions. This mechanism is used in both the encoder and decoder of the Transformer architecture. In the encoder, self-attention layers allow each position to attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. In the decoder, self-attention layers are modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring that predictions for a position depend only on known outputs at earlier positions [Source 1, Source 2, Source 4].\n\nSelf-attention has been successfully applied to tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations [Source 1].",

      "answer": "Multi-head attention layers in the Transformer architecture work by allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions simultaneously. Each attention head operates independently, and their outputs are concatenated and projected to produce the final values. This mechanism enables the model to capture diverse aspects of the input data without the averaging limitations of single-head attention.\n\nThe formula for multi-head attention is:\n\n**MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head₁, ..., headₕ)Wₒ**,  \nwhere **headᵢ = Attention(QWQᵢ, KWKᵢ, VWVᵢ)**.\n\nHere:\n- **Q**, **K**, and **V** represent the queries, keys, and values, respectively.\n- **WQᵢ**, **WKᵢ**, **WVᵢ**, and **Wₒ** are parameter matrices for projections.\n- The dimensions of each head are reduced, with **dₖ = dᵥ = dₘₒₑₗ / h = 64**, where **dₘₒₑₗ = 512** and **h = 8** (number of attention heads).\n\nThis design ensures that the computational cost remains similar to single-head attention while improving the model's ability to learn dependencies across positions. Multi-head attention is applied in three ways in the Transformer:\n1. **Encoder-decoder attention**: Queries come from the decoder, while keys and values come from the encoder output, allowing the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence.\n2. **Self-attention in the encoder**: Each position in the encoder attends to all positions in the previous encoder layer.\n3. **Self-attention in the decoder**: Each position in the decoder attends to all positions up to and including itself, with masking to prevent attending to future positions.\n\nThis mechanism is central to the Transformer’s ability to model global dependencies efficiently without relying on recurrence or convolution.

      "answer": "The provided context does not explicitly mention transformer-based AI systems or their specific regulation under the EU AI Act. However, based on the general framework described:\n\n1. **Risk Classification**: Transformer-based AI systems would likely be classified according to their risk level:\n   - If they are used in applications deemed **high-risk** (e.g., safety-critical systems or those covered by Annex I laws requiring third-party conformity assessments), they would be subject to stringent regulations [Source 1; Source 2].\n   - If they are used in applications with **limited risk** (e.g., chatbots or deepfakes), they would have lighter transparency obligations, such as ensuring end-users are aware they are interacting with AI [Source 1].\n   - If they are considered **minimal risk** (e.g., generative AI for entertainment purposes like video games), they may remain unregulated [Source 1].\n\n2. **Obligations**: The majority of obligations for high-risk AI systems fall on providers (developers), including those outside the EU if their systems' output is used within the EU. Users (deployers) of high-risk systems also have some obligations, though less stringent than those for providers [Source 1].\n\n3. **Deadlines**: If transformer-based systems are classified as high-risk under Annex III or Annex I, they would need to comply within 24 months or 36 months, respectively, after the AI Act's entry into force [Source 3].\n\nIn summary, transformer-based AI systems would be regulated based on their risk classification and use case, with high-risk systems facing the most stringent requirements. For further details specific to transformer-based AI, additional context would be needed.",
